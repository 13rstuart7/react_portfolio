    <p>My name is Reiken Stuart, I am happily married and have two beautiful children. I have worked in sales for the past few years but recently 
      decided to go back to school. I was curious what courses I wanted to take and having heard much about this career feild from my mother in law
      I thought that this would be an exciting and fun new adventure. I love to play sports, video games and spend time with family and friends. I am 
      also a car and motorcycle enthusiast. I am very excited to see where coding can take me and how much there is to learn.
